## A daily percentage calculator


I needed a calculator to do reports of percentage of daily time.

How does it work?

`Insert the amount of hours [0-23]: X hours` <br>
`Insert the amount of minutes [0-59]: X minutes`

After the insert, the console will show the time percentage based on 24 hours.
